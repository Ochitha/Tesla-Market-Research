# Tesla-Market-Research
A market research proposal was created based on the client brief provided by Tesla. The market research proposal outlines the multitude of ways that Tesla could achieve substantial development and further its position in the electric vehicle industry by pursuing its objectives. The proposal analysed changes in brand perceptions, automobile user attitudes as well as their appetites and the consistent changes in the industry.

The steps to be taken are clearly detailed with various analysis tools such as cross-tabulations and ANOVA were suggested to achieve an overall understanding on Tesla and non-Tesla customers. Limitations for the study were also noted down and a questionnaire for both types of customers were provided in an easy to apply way.
